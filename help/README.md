# Pakka: LMS Project

## WE ARE A COMMUNITY OF INDIVIDUALS UNITED BY A COMMON GOAL

Many people ask us why we have such a unique company. The answer is simple: our people. Our team members work every day to ensure we provide quality products in a happy workplace. Our board offers us their wisdom and keeps us on track (and honest, too!) Lastly, we are blessed with mentors who love our vision and want to help us make good things happen.

## IT’S SIMPLE. WE JUST WANT TO DO BETTER: LEAVE THE PLANET CLEANER.

Pakka is a company of people who believe in contributing to our world through business. What’s our bit? We create sustainable
packaging with agri-residue.
